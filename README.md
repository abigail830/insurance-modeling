# Insurance Domain Modeling

A comprehensive collection of PlantUML diagrams for modeling insurance business domains, focusing on contracts, claims, and case management systems.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains domain models and entity relationship diagrams for insurance business processes, designed to help understand and visualize the complex relationships between different entities in the insurance ecosystem.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The models are organized into several key domains:

### Core Business Domains
- **Contract Management**: Insurance contracts, policies, and related documentation
- **Claims Processing**: Claims handling and processing workflows
- **Case Management**: End-to-end case tracking and management
- **Party Management**: Stakeholders including policyholders, insureds, beneficiaries

## üéØ Key Features

### Domain Models Include:
- **Contract Context**: Contract holders, contracts, and their relationships
- **Policy Context**: Policyholders, insured persons, beneficiaries, and policies
- **Claims Context**: Claims processing and document management
- **Case Management Context**: End-to-end case tracking with initiators and owners

### Model Characteristics:
- **Package-based Organization**: Clear separation of concerns using PlantUML packages
- **Bilingual Support**: Models available in both English and Chinese
- **Abstract Patterns**: Extensible case management using abstract entities
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history tracking for case management
- **Role-based Access**: Clear distinction between initiators and case owners

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) installed locally, or
- Use [PlantUML Online Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)

### Viewing the Diagrams

1. **Local Rendering**:
   ```bash
   plantuml big-model.puml
   plantuml contract.puml
   ```

2. **Online Viewing**:
   - Copy the content of any `.puml` file
   - Paste it into [PlantUML Online Editor](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)

3. **IDE Integration**:
   - VS Code: Install "PlantUML" extension
   - IntelliJ IDEA: Built-in PlantUML support

## üìù Best Practices

### When Modifying Models:
- Maintain package organization
- Keep entity relationships clear and simple
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex relationships
- Test diagram rendering before committing

### Model Design Principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each package handles a specific domain
- **Abstraction**: Use abstract entities for extensible patterns
- **Simplicity**: Avoid unnecessary complexity in relationships
- **Clarity**: Prefer direct relationships over association tables for logical models

**Note**: These models are designed for logical domain analysis, not physical database design. They focus on business relationships and concepts rather than implementation details.
